    "### Ans-\n",
    "### The abc module in Python stands for Abstract Base Classes. It is a module that provides mechanisms for defining abstract base classes in Python. Abstract base classes (ABCs) are classes that are designed to be subclassed, but not instantiated directly. They provide a way to define a common interface or a contract for a group of subclasses. The abc module provides the ABC class as the base class for creating abstract base classes. It also provides the abstractmethod decorator, which is used to define abstract methods within the abstract base class. An abstract method is a method that is declared but does not provide an implementation in the abstract base class. The subclasses of the abstract base class must implement these abstract methods.\n",
    "### Here are some key reasons why the abc module is used:\n",
    "### Defining common interfaces: Abstract base classes allow you to define a common interface or contract that a group of subclasses should adhere to. By defining abstract methods, you can ensure that the subclasses provide the necessary implementations.\n",
    "### Polymorphism: Abstract base classes enable polymorphism, which means you can use instances of different subclasses interchangeably through the common interface defined by the abstract base class. This promotes code reusability and flexibil"

    "### Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "### Ans-\n",
    "### We can acheive data abstaction as follows:\n",
    "### 1. Define a class: A class is a blueprint or a template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It encapsulates data (attributes) and operations (methods) that manipulate that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Identify the essential data: Determine the essential data that needs to be encapsulated within the class. These data attributes should represent the state or characteristics of objects of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Encapsulate data: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods together within a class. The data attributes are typically declared as private or protected, meaning they cannot be directly accessed from outside the class. This hides the internal representation of the data and prevents direct manipulation, enforcing controlled access through methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Define methods: Methods are functions defined within the class that operate on the data attributes. They provide the interface through which external code interacts with the class. Methods can be used to read or modify the data attributes, perform computations, and provide other relevant behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Access data through methods: Instead of directly accessing the data attributes, external code interacts with the class by calling the methods provided by the class. These methods can provide controlled access to the data, ensuring proper validation, data consistency, and hiding the implementation details.\n",
